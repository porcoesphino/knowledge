The phylogenetic tree is based on work in [The Invertebrate Tree of Life
Gonzalo Giribet and Gregory D. Edgecombe](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691170251/the-invertebrate-tree-of-life).

The base of the phylogenetic tree is controversial and may be revised.

The nine animal phyla that include the majority of animal life are:

- Porifera — sponges
- Cnidaria — corals / jellyfish
- Bilateria — all bilaterally symmetrical animals

  - Xenacoelomorphia
  - Nephrozoa

    - Protostomia — blastopore becomes mouth

      - Spiralia — undergo spiral cleavage

        - Platyhelminthes — free living and parasitic flat worms
        - Mollusca — snails / slugs / cephalopods/ bivalves
        - Annelida — segmented worms

      - Ecdysozoa — have a cuticle that is shed

        - Nematoda — roundworms
        - Arthropoda — insects / arachnids / crustaceans

    - Deuterostomia — blastopore becomes anus

      - Echinodermata — sea stars / sea cucumbers
      - Chordata — snakes / birds / humans / whales

The choanoflagellates are thought to be sister clade to all animals.
